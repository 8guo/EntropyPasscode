# Entropy Passcode
Java application which uses mouse click locations as a form of entropy to generate a strong password.

## Help
This application currently only generates passcodes 20 characters long. 

To get started, click anywhere within the frame to fill up the progress bar. The more random the locations, the better. You may also resize the application as you wish. After the progress bar is filled up, the passcode frame will be displayed. Select which types of characters you wish to include in the passcode, and click generate!
